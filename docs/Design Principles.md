# Design Principles

Keep things simple. Focus. Try to find out how the persistent message buses would change our way of expressing data flows and building microservices.

Look from a customer point of view.

Tests First.

Leave implementations to people who know their products best.

Try to learn from existing, way older systems like Unix file system and piping (and Typesafe Config).
