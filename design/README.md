# Design

## Principles

Keep things simple. Focus. Try to find out how the persistent message buses would change our way of expressing data flows and building microservices.

Tests First.

Provide reasonably real world, repeatable test cases for comparing the performance characteristics of various back-ends.

Leave implementations to people who know their products best.

Try to learn from existing, way older systems like Unix file system.
